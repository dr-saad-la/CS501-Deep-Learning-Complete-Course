    "# Setting Up TensorBoard in Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This comprehensive guide walks you through the process of setting up TensorBoard within Jupyter Notebook environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before proceeding with the setup, ensure you have:\n",
    "- Python 3.6 or later installed\n",
    "- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed\n",
    "- pip package manager\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Installing Core Components\n",
    "\n",
    "First, install the main TensorBoard package. You can do this either through the command line or within a Jupyter notebook cell:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Command Line:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install tensorboard\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Jupyter Notebook:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "!pip install tensorboard\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Installing Profiler Plugin\n",
    "\n",
    "The TensorBoard Profiler plugin provides insights into model performance and resource utilization:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Command Line:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install tensorboard-plugin-profile\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Jupyter Notebook:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "!pip install tensorboard-plugin-profile\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Optional Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "While not required for basic functionality, the following packages enhance TensorBoard's capabilities when working with various data formats:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install tensorflow-io\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "When installing packages through Jupyter Notebook cells, it's important to properly configure the environment path. Add the following code at the beginning of your notebook to ensure proper package accessibility:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import os\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add Python executable directory to PATH\n",
    "env_path = os.path.dirname(sys.executable)\n",
    "os.environ['PATH'] = f\"{env_path}:{os.environ['PATH']}\"\n",
    "```"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "id": "965e3f81-f5d3-45c9-b7b2-5d2a0ec93df0",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## Verification\n",
    "\n",
    "To verify your installation, run the following code in a notebook cell:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Import TensorBoard\n",
    "from tensorboard import notebook\n",
    "print(\"TensorBoard installation successful!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Issues and Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Package Not Found Error**: If you encounter this error, try running pip with the `--user` flag:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pip install --user tensorboard\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Path Issues**: If TensorBoard isn't recognized after installation, ensure you've run the environment configuration code provided above.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing the setup, you can:\n",
    "- Launch TensorBoard directly from your notebooks\n",
    "- Create and monitor training experiments\n",
    "- Visualize model graphs and metrics\n",
    "- Analyze training performance\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information about using TensorBoard in your projects, refer to the official [TensorBoard documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/get_started)."

    "# Verifying TensorBoard Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will guide you step by step to verify your TensorBoard installation across different environments and operating systems. While the installation process may vary depending on your setup, these verification methods will help ensure TensorBoard is properly configured.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment Compatibility\n",
    "\n",
    "The verification steps have been tested on the following configurations:\n",
    "- JupyterLab Desktop Application\n",
    "- JupyterLab Web-based Application\n",
    "- macOS (Primary test environment)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: While these steps are primarily tested on macOS, they should work similarly on other operating systems with minor adjustments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Verification Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method 1: Direct Import\n",
    "The simplest way to verify your installation is through direct import:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    import tensorboard\n",
    "    print(f\"TensorBoard version: {tensorboard.__version__}\")\n",
    "except ImportError as e:\n",
    "    print(f\"Error importing TensorBoard: {e}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method 2: Notebook Extension Check\n",
    "Verify the TensorBoard notebook extension:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from tensorboard import notebook\n",
    "notebook.list() # Should display available TensorBoard instances\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method 3: Command Line Verification\n",
    "Check TensorBoard availability in your environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Run in notebook cell\n",
    "!which tensorboard\n",
    "!tensorboard --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method 4: Package Installation Verification\n",
    "Verify installation through pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "!pip show tensorboard\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment Path Verification\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure your Jupyter environment recognizes TensorBoard, verify the Python path:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "import os\n",
    "\n",
    "# Display Python executable location\n",
    "print(f\"Python executable: {sys.executable}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Display current Python path\n",
    "for path in sys.path:\n",
    "    print(path)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Troubleshooting Common Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Import Errors\n",
    "If you encounter import errors:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import site\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add user site-packages to path if needed\n",
    "user_site = site.getusersitepackages()\n",
    "if user_site not in sys.path:\n",
    "    sys.path.append(user_site)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Environment Path Issues\n",
    "If TensorBoard is installed but not found:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import os\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "\n",
    "# Update environment PATH\n",
    "env_path = os.path.dirname(sys.executable)\n",
    "os.environ['PATH'] = f\"{env_path}:{os.environ['PATH']}\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Jupyter Kernel Issues\n",
    "If TensorBoard isn't recognized in Jupyter:\n",
    "1. Verify the correct kernel is selected\n",
    "2. Restart the kernel\n",
    "3. Run the following to check kernel information:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import IPython\n",
    "print(IPython.sys_info())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment-Specific Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "### JupyterLab Desktop\n",
    "- Ensure TensorBoard is installed in the same environment as JupyterLab\n",
    "- Check if the environment is properly activated before launching JupyterLab\n",
    "\n",
    "### JupyterLab Web-based\n",
    "- Verify server environment configuration\n",
    "- Ensure proper network permissions for TensorBoard dashboard\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "After successful verification:\n",
    "1. Test TensorBoard visualization capabilities\n",
    "2. Set up your first logging directory\n",
    "3. Launch the TensorBoard dashboard\n",
    "\n",
    "If you encounter persistent issues, consider:\n",

    "Let us move to use another more robust way:\n",
    "  - We need to import the `sys` module\n",
    "  - Check your Python path:\n",
    "      - To do that use `print(sys.path)`\n",
    "      - If the path of your active environement is different than the one you installed your package in, then you need:\n",
    "          - Either configure your jupyter notebook to use that environment\n",
    "          - If the previous step is done properly, then select the correct kernel:\n",
    "              - Jupyter Lab desktop: From the menu `kernel --> change kernel`\n",
    "              - Jupyter lab web based: Activate the environment from a command line then launch the app using `jupyter lab .` this way, it will pick up that environment. \n",
    "              \n",
    "After finding the correct path, you just need to use that to check the installation:      \n",
    "  - Find the correct path the current session of your jupyter lab is using `!{sys.executable}`\n",
    "  - Proceed with `pip` in that specific path\n",

    "This probably will work on every platform:"
